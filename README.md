In this code, I worked on building a C program that processes an array of integers, implements a learned index technique for fast search, and reduces the search time to O(1) in ideal cases. The program involves reading and sorting input data, calculating mapping functions, and performing searches with the goal of minimizing prediction errors and efficiently locating search keys within the array.
